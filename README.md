# ConnectFourClient

## Simple Server-Client application to connect with peers and play Connect Four.

This project was done during a mini 7-hour hackathon, Battle of the Code, during my summer internship at CDK Global.

The objective of this exercise was to learn computer networking and how to set up server-client applications as well as to code a simple AI program to play Connect Four against our peers.

At the end of the exercise, we all put our programs against each other to see who did best. :)
